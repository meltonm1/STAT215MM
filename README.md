Description
This repository contains the R code and related files for analyzing the relationship between the percentage of low-income students (VAR 1) and graduation rates (dependent variable). The analysis utilizes a linear regression model to explore how socioeconomic disparities affect educational outcomes. This project includes data cleaning, operationalization, and statistical analysis, providing a comprehensive framework for understanding the relationship between these two variables.

Operationalization of Variables
Percentage of Low-Income Students (VAR 1):
This variable represents the proportion of students in a school who are classified as low-income, expressed as a percentage.
Measurement Scale: Quantitative (Ratio).
This variable was selected because it reflects the socioeconomic composition of a school and is often linked to resource availability and educational challenges.
Graduation Rates (Dependent Variable):

This variable represents the percentage of students in a school who successfully graduate.
Measurement Scale: Quantitative (Ratio).
Graduation rates are a key indicator of educational success and provide insight into how socioeconomic factors may impact student outcomes.
Data Cleaning Process
Loading the Dataset:

The dataset is imported into R using the read.csv() function.
Missing values are removed using the na.omit() function to ensure only complete cases are included in the analysis.
Variable Preparation:

The percentage of low-income students and graduation rates are extracted and analyzed.
New variables are computed if necessary (e.g., log transformations).
Assumption Testing:

Residual plots are used to check for normality, linearity, and homoscedasticity of errors.
How to Use This Package
Clone the Repository:

Clone the repository to your local machine using the command:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/repository-name.git
Install Required R Packages:

Ensure you have the following R packages installed:
ggplot2 for visualizations.
dplyr for data manipulation.
stats for regression analysis.
Use the install.packages() function in R to install any missing packages.
Run the Analysis:

Open the R script file analysis.R in R Studio or your preferred IDE.
Execute the script to load, clean, and analyze the data.

The code generates a scatter plot of the relationship between low-income students and graduation rates, along with the regression line.
Residual plots are included to assess model assumptions.
The output includes descriptive statistics, regression coefficients, ùëÖ2, and significance values.
